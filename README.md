Learning how to git

Step 1: cloning a repo.
Get to the repo, press clone or download using SSH, get in terminal, type 
`git clone [hyperlink to repo]`

Step 2: commiting changes
run `git diff` if you want to see the changes you've made
run `git add [filename]` to put file/files in the staging area
run `git commit -m [little message about what you did in the changes]` to 
commit the files

Step 2: commiting changes (again)
run `git gui` and use it

Step 3: pushing and pulling into the cloud
to move your local commits into the cloud (github), run `git push` 
to get updates from a repo, run `git pull`
